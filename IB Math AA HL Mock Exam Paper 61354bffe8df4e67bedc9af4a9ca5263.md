## Section B - Detailed Instructions

Choose two of the following questions to answer.

### Question 7 - Differential Equations

Solve the following differential equation:

$\frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy$

To solve this differential equation, we can separate the variables and integrate both sides with respect to their respective variables:

$\int \frac{1}{y} dy = \int 2x dx$

This gives us:

$\ln|y| = x^2 + C$

where $C$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $y$ gives us:

$y = \pm e^{x^2+C}$

### Question 8 - Partial Fractions

Find the partial fraction decomposition of the following rational function:

$\frac{3x^2 + 2x - 1}{x^3 - 1}$

To find the partial fraction decomposition, we first factor the denominator as:

$x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2+x+1)$

We can then write the rational function as:

$\frac{3x^2 + 2x - 1}{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx+C}{x^2+x+1}$

Solving for $A$, $B$, and $C$ gives us:

$A = 1$
$B = 2$
$C = -3$

So the partial fraction decomposition is:

$\frac{3x^2 + 2x - 1}{x^3 - 1} = \frac{1}{x-1} + \frac{2x-3}{x^2+x+1}$

### Question 9 - Calculus

Use the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the following function:

$f(x) = \sqrt{3x + 1}$

Using the limit definition of the derivative, we have:

$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{3(x+h)+1} - \sqrt{3x+1}}{h}$

To simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the numerator:

$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(3(x+h)+1) - (3x+1)}{h(\sqrt{3(x+h)+1} + \sqrt{3x+1})}$

Simplifying this expression gives us:

$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3h}{h(\sqrt{3(x+h)+1} + \sqrt{3x+1})}$

Canceling out the $h$ terms, we have:

$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3}{\sqrt{3(x+h)+1} + \sqrt{3x+1}}$

Evaluating this limit gives us:

$f'(x) = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3x+1}}$

### Question 10 - Differential Equations

Find the general solution of the following differential equation:

$y'' - 2y' + y = e^x$

To find the general solution of this differential equation, we first solve the characteristic equation:

$r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0$

This factors as:

$(r-1)^2 = 0$

So the characteristic equation has a double root of $r=1$. This gives us the complementary solution:

$y_c(x) = (C_1 + C_2x)e^x$

To find the particular solution, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Since $e^x$ is already a solution to the complementary equation, we can guess a particular solution of the form:

$y_p(x) = Ax e^x$

Taking the derivatives of $y_p(x)$ and substituting into the differential equation, we get:

$Ae^x - 2Axe^x + Ax e^x = e^x$

Simplifying this expression gives us:

$A = \frac{1}{2}$

So the particular solution is:

$y_p(x) = \frac{1}{2}xe^x$

Therefore, the general solution is:

$y(x) = (C_1 + C_2x)e^x + \frac{1}{2}xe^x$

### Question 11 - Calculus

Find the area bounded by the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$, the $x$-axis, and the lines $x = 0$ and $x = 4$.

To find the area bounded by the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$ and the $x$-axis, we need to integrate the function from $x=0$ to $x=4$:

$\int_0^4 \sqrt{x} dx = \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}} \bigg|_0^4 = \frac{16}{3}$

Therefore, the area bounded by the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$, the $x$-axis, and the lines $x = 0$ and $x = 4$ is $\frac{16}{3}$ square units.

### Question 12 - Trigonometry

Use the identity $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$ to prove that $\tan^2(x) + 1 = \sec^2(x)$.

Starting with the identity $\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1$, we can divide both sides by $\cos^2(x)$:

$\frac{\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} + \frac{\cos^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)}$

Simplifying this expression gives us:

$\tan^2(x) + 1 = \sec^2(x)$

Therefore, $\tan^2(x) + 1 = \sec^2(x)$ is a true identity.

Good luck!
